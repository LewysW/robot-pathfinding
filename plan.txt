1. Change boolean for buttons in PotentialFields.java to enum so that one in three buttons can be enabled at a time. [DONE]

2. Look at move() (euclidean distance) and arcMove() (arc) functions. Write equivalent fracProgrMove() function [Done]

3.. Within fracProgMove() function, need to call evaluateSamplePointsFracProg() similar to evaluateSamplePointsArc() for Arc and evaluateSamplePoints() for Euclidean.

4. Within evaluateSamplePointsFracProg() function need to call evalMoveFracProg() function, similar to evalMoveArc() for Arc (from evaluateSamplePointsArc()) and evalMove() for Euclidean (from evaluateSamplePoints())

SUMMARY OF FUNCTIONS REQUIRED (Moving down the call stack): fracProgMove() -> evaluateSamplePointsFracProg() -> evalMoveFracProg()
